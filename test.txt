                             JACK (V.O.)
                 People were always asking me, did I
                 know Tyler Durden.

     FADE IN:

     INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

     TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
     holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
     Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

     They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
     is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
     dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With a gun barrel between your teeth,
                 you only speak in vowels.

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I can't think of anything.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With my tongue, I can feel the
                 rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
                 I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
                 controlled demolition thing and I
                 wondered how clean this gun is.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 That old saying, how you always hurt
                 the one you love, well, it works both
                 way.

     Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We have front row seats for this
                 Theater of Mass Destruction.  The
                 Demolitions Committee of Project
                 Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
                 of ten buildings with blasting
                 gelatin.  In two minutes, primary
                 charges will blow base charges, and
                 those buildings will be reduced to
                 smoldering rubble.  I know this
                 because Tyler knows this.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplised.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
                 gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
                 really about Marla Singer.

     PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE
     BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is
     engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob had bitch tits.

     PULL BACK to wide on...

     INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
     Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This was a support group for men with
                 testicular cancer.  The big moosie
                 slobbering all over me was Bob.

                             BOB
                 We're still men.

                             JACK
                 Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
                 removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He
                 developed bitch tits because his
                 testosterone was too high and his
                 body upped the estrogen.  That was
                 where my head fit -- into his huge,
                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the
                 way we think of God's as big.

                             BOB
                 They're gonna have to open my pec's
                 again to drain the fluid.

     Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.

                             BOB
                 Okay.  You cry now.

     Jack looks at Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For six months.  I could not sleep.

     INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup
     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With insomnia, nothing is real.
                 Everything is far away.  Everything
                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.

     Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.
     Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME

     Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the
     floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When deep space exploration ramps up,
                 it will be corporations that name
                 everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.
                 The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet
                 Starbucks.

     Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks
     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 I'm going to need you out-of-town a
                 little more this week.  We've got
                 some "red-flags" to cover.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It must've been Tuesday.  he was
                 wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

                             JACK
                       (listless management speak)
                 You want me to de-prioritize my
                 current reports until you advise of
                 a status upgrade?

                             BOSS
                 You need to make these your primary
                 "action items."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was full of pep.  Must've had his
                 grande latte enema.

                             BOSS
                 Here are your flight coupons.  Call
                 me from the road if there are any
                 snags.  Your itinerary...

     Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.

     INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT

     Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips
     through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy
     magazines and other catalogs nearby.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like everyone else, I had become a
                 slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika
                 Pekkari slip covers.

     Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.

     MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I saw something like clever coffee
                 table sin the shape of a yin and
                 yang, I had to have it.

     PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like the Johanneshov armchair in the
                 Strinne green stripe pattern...

     INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN

     The armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
                 environmentally-friendly unbleached
                 paper.

     The lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even the Vild hall clock of
                 galvanized steel, resting on the
                 Klipsk shelving unit.

     The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I would flip through catalogs and
                 wonder, "What kind of dining set
                 defines me as a person?"  We used to
                 read pornography.  Now it was the
                 Horchow Collection.

     A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still
     glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.

                             JACK
                 No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that
                 sounds nice.  Apricot.

     Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had it all.  Even the glass dishes
                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
                 proof they were crafted by the
                 honest, simple, hard-working
                 indigenous peoples of wherever.

     He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically
     empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses
     a butter knife to eat it.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who
     studies him with bemusement.

                             INTERN
                 No, you can't die of insomnia.

                             JACK
                 Maybe I died already.  Look at my
                 face.

                             INTERN
                 You need to lighten up.

                             JACK
                 Can't you give me something?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
                 Seconals.

                             INTERN
                       (overlapping w/ above)
                 You need healthy, natural sleep.
                 Chew valerian root and get some more
                 exercise.

     The Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the...

     INT. HALLWAY

     The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.

                             JACK
                 I'm in pain.

                             INTERN
                       (facetious)
                 You want to see pain?  Swing by First
                 Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the
                 guys with testicular cancer.  That's
                 pain.

     The Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack heads for the front door.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all
     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER
     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

                             SPEAKER
                 I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and
                 a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and
                 one boy.  We never could agree on
                 anything.

     The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to
     lighten the mood.

                             SPEAKER
                 Well, she had her first child a month
                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...
                 And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,
                 because she deserves...

     The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.

     Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,
     comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.

                             LEADER
                 Everyone, let's thank Thomas for
                 sharing himself with us.

     Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:

                             EVERYONE
                       (in unison)
                 Thank you, Thomas.

                             LEADER
                 I look around this room and I see a
                 lot of courage.  And it gives me
                 strength.  We give each other
                 strength.

     Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.
     Jack squirms in his seat.

                             LEADER
                 It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's
                 follow Thomas's example and open
                 ourselves.

     Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.
     Jack stands, uncomfortable.

                             LEADER
                 Can everyone find a partner?

     Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,
     shuffling his feet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The big moosie, his eyes already
                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees
                 together, invisible steps.

     Bob takes Jack into an embrace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You
                 know that chest expansion program you
                 see on TV?  That was his idea.

                             BOB
                 ...using steroids.  I was a juicer.
                 Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for
                 racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm
                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
                 won't return my calls...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Strangers with this kind of honesty
                 make me go a big rubbery one.

     Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder
     and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of
     crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.

                             BOB
                 Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.

     They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then... something happened.  I was
                 lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
                 and complete.

     Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens
     his arms around Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I found freedom.  Losing all hope was
                 freedom.

     Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET
     MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Babies don't sleep this well.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies sound asleep.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became addicted.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and
     women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."

     INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to
     cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I didn't say anything, people
                 assumed the worst.  They cried
                 harder.  I cried harder.

     INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

     Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES
     CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Tonight, we're going to open the
                 green door -- the heart chakra...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host
                 to cancer or parasites; I was the
                 warm little center that the life of
                 this world crowded around.

                             LEADER
                 ...And you open the door and you
                 step inside.  We're inside our
                 hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a
                 white ball of healing light.  That's
                 right, the pain itself is a ball of
                 healing light.

     Jack, eyes closed, is silent...

                             LEADER
                 It moves over your body, healing you.
                 Keep this going and step forward,
                 through the back door of the room.
                 Where does it lead?  To your cave.
                 Step forward into your cave.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...

                             LEADER'S VOICE
                 That's right.  You're going deeper
                 into your cave.  And you're going to
                 find your power animal...

     Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks
     his head to signal Jack forward.

                             PENGUIN
                 Slide.

     The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.
